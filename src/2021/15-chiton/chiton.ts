const findLowestRisk = (input: string) => {};

// Candidates BFS algorithm
//  - this finds a path, but doesn't evaluate criteria

// Backtracking algorithms?
//  - not sure how to apply, but need to check all possible routes?
//  - complexity in that going with the smallest number isn't guaranteed to be
// the lowest risk path

// Search algorithms
//  - understanding DFS and BFS
//  - 'Search problems are those in which our task is to find 
// the optimal path between a start node and a goal node in a graph'

// Something like depth first search
// go down the 'left path'
